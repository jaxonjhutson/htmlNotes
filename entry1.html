        <p>Gummy bears are pretty good, I can't find a thing to hate on them for. Conversely, the gummy bear song was drilled into my head as a child by my sister, and I'm really not a fan of it. As for flavors, I think of the traditionl flavors, I probably like orange the best, especially if it's a brand that makes sure to actually differentiate its flavors.</p>
